# HTML-TAG-CHECKER

1) Developed an agrithms to check all the tags if they are nested correctly 
2) Create a stack to store all the opening tags.
3) Pop the stack if found closing tag to check if both match:
4) Example: <title> vs <title/> not match because single sided. < body > vs </ body > is match 
5) Checking for special cases to ignore if it is a comment ....etc
