# HTML-TAG-CHECKER

1) Developed an agrithms to check all the tags if they are nested correctly 
2) Create a stack to store all the opening tags.
3) Pop the stack if found closing tag to check if both match:
4) Example:                    <b> vs </b> is match, <title> vs <title/> not match because single sided..
5) Checking for special cases such as ignore if it is a comment ....etc
